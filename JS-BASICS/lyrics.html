      Lyrics They say, "The holy water's watered down And this town's lost its
      faith Our colors will fade eventually" So if our time is runnin' out Day
      after day We'll make the mundane our masterpiece Oh my, my Oh my, my love
      I take one look at you You're takin' me out of the ordinary I want you
      layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried On the edge of your knife,
      stayin' drunk on your vine The angels up in the clouds are jealous,
      knowin' we found Somethin' so out of the ordinary You got me kissin' the
      ground of your sanctuary Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to
      dust The angels up in the clouds are jealous, knowin' we found Hopeless
      hallelujah On this side of Heaven's gate Oh, my life, how do ya Breathe
      and take my breath away? At your altar, I will pray You're the sculptor,
      I'm the clay Oh my, my You're takin' me out of the ordinary I want you
      layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried On the edge of your knife,
      stayin' drunk on your vine The angels up in the clouds are jealous,
      knowin' we found Somethin' so out (out) of the ordinary (ordinary) You got
      me kissin' the ground (ground) of your sanctuary (sanctuary) Shatter me
      with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust The angels up in the clouds
      are jealous, knowin' we found Somethin' so heavenly, higher than ecstasy
      Whenever you're next to me, oh my, my World was in black and white until I
      saw your light I thought you had to die to find Somethin' so out of the
      ordinary I want you layin' me down 'til we're dead and buried On the edge
      of your knife, stayin' drunk on your vine The angels up in the clouds are
      jealous, knowin' we found Somethin' so out (out) of the ordinary You got
      me kissin' the ground (ground) of your sanctuary (sanctuary) Shatter me
      with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust The angels up in the clouds
      are jealous, knowin' we found
